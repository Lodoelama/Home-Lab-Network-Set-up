# Setting up a Home Cybersecurity Lab with Virtual Machines on an HP Laptop

## Introduction:
As a cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing a certification from Columbia Engineering Boot Camps, setting up a home lab with virtual machines is crucial for gaining hands-on experience and practicing cybersecurity skills. A home lab provides a safe environment to experiment with various tools, techniques, and configurations without affecting real-world systems or networks.

## Goals:
The objectives of the home lab include:

Familiarizing oneself with different operating systems, such as Windows and Linux.

Practicing the installation, configuration, and use of cybersecurity tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit.

Simulating network environments to gain a better understanding of network protocols and traffic.

Enhancing problem-solving skills by troubleshooting and resolving issues in a controlled environment.

Building a foundation for pursuing a career in cybersecurity, such as working as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst or a penetration tester.

## Hardware Requirements:

For this home lab setup, an average HP laptop with the following specifications will be used:

CPU: Intel Core i5 or equivalent

RAM: 8 GB or higher

Storage: 256 GB SSD or higher

Network: Wi-Fi adapter

These specifications should be sufficient for running a couple of virtual machines concurrently without significantly impacting the laptop's performance.

## In the next section, we'll go into detail on the software requirements, lab setup process, and the experience of setting up and configuring virtual machines on an HP laptop for cybersecurity practice.


## Software Requirements:

The softwares required for the home lab:

Virtualization software VirtualBox

Operating systems  Kali Linux 

Security tools and applications Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap


## Lab Setup:

The steps to set up the home lab, including:

Installing virtualization software

Download and install the virtualization software VirtualBox compatible with your HP laptop.

Configure the software according to your system's specifications.

Setting up virtual machines

Download the required operating system ISO images (e.g., Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server).

Create new virtual machines for each operating system.

Allocate resources (CPU, RAM, storage) for each virtual machine, considering the laptop's hardware limitations.

Install the operating systems on the virtual machines.

## Configuring network settings

Set up virtual networks (e.g., host-only, NAT, or bridged).

Assign IP addresses and configure network settings for each virtual machine.

Installing and configuring services

Install services like web servers, databases, or other applications based on your learning objectives.

Configure the services according to your lab's goals and requirements.

## Security Tools and Applications:

Explain how to install and configure the security tools and applications you'll be using in your lab, such as:

Wireshark for network analysis

Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation

Nmap for network scanning

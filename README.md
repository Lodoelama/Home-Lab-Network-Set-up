# Virtualization with Kali Purple

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the setup I have on my Kali Linux machines.

## Overview

Virtualization is a technique for creating virtual versions of computer hardware platforms, operating systems, or network resources. I am familiar with different types of virtualization, including full virtualization, paravirtualization, and containerization.

## Configuration

I have configured my virtualization software to allocate resources like CPU, memory, and storage to my virtual machines based on the requirements of the specific use case.

## Virtual Machines

I have set up multiple virtual machines on my Kali Linux machines for different purposes, including:

- Windows 10 for testing Windows-based applications and tools
- Ubuntu for testing Linux-based applications and tools
- Metasploitable for practicing penetration testing techniques

Feel free to explore the repository and the virtual machines I have set up
